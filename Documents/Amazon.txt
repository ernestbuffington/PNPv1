Description

NukeAmazon is a complete software package for Amazon Affiliate members. The

software allows members to advertise products sold by Amazon in their PHP-Nuke

(http://phpnuke.org/) powered Web sites. This package uses the Amazon Web Services

version 3.0 via XML-based protocols to integrate Amazon.com features and content into

PHP-Nuke site. Included in this package are blocks and administration / configuration

files that allows the Web site Administrator to manage very easily the selected Amazon

products. NukeAmazon is simple to install and manage. You enter Amazon product

numbers (ASIN) in the admin page and the script does the rest. It has a hits and click

counter so you know which featured and not featured items are more popular and have

been sent to Amazon for purchase. It gets the product's information available from

Amazon’s servers and displays it in your web site. Every time the page is refreshed a

new item is shown on the Amazon block. When the site visitor clicks on the item, the

server loads a page with detailed information of the item. Related items and a search

form are shown so that your visitor sees more products that are available for purchase so

you can earn more commissions. You can add product reviews and link to them into the

NukeAmazon store. NukeAmazon has been tested to work with PHP-Nuke 6.9 - 7.4.

How NukeAmazon works?

Your site visitors are presented featured items via a side block (block-Amazon.php).

Featured items are products that are stored in the Nuke database by the site

administrator. When the visitor clicks on the product link, it is directed to a product

details page. This details page will show all available details for the product and also will

present product reviews, related products, and suggested products. On the products

NukeAmazon is distributed AS IS, without any warranty nor technical support according to the GPL license.

details page your visitor will click on the product link will be directed to the Amazon.com

site to purchase it.

If your visitor clicks on the direct NukeAmazon store link the complete catalog with

Amazon browsenodes will be presented along with some of the featured items to tease

your visitor. A catalog browse bar is presented on every page so that your site visitor

can select in what catalog to search products.

A shopping cart has been developed that will allow your site visitor to put all the items

he/she wishes to purchase and at the end will go to Amazon to finalize the purchase.
